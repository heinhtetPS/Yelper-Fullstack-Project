## [Yelper](https://yelper2017.herokuapp.com/#/)

Yelper is a full stack web application inspired by Yelp.com. It utilizes React.js with Redux on the frontend to produce dynamic content and a PostgreSql database backend. Ruby on rails serves a nice framework that connects the two and provides structure for the app.
