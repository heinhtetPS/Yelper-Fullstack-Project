# [Yelper](https://yelper2017.herokuapp.com/#/)
=================

Yelper is a full stack web application inspired by Yelp.com. It utilizes React.js with Redux on the frontend to produce dynamic content and a PostgreSql database backend. Ruby on rails serves a nice framework that connects the two and provides structure for the app.

## Features and Implementation
================

### GoogleMaps Integration  
One of the things I was most excited to tackle was the ability to learn about and utilize the GoogleMaps API to implement maps into this app. In fact, I specifically sought out projects that included maps so that I could engage with this particular technology.

In Yelper, maps are one of the central features and one of the most important parts of each business's attributes.
