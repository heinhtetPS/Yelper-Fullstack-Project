Issues
- Review post reportedly has problems on different machines
- Sometimes there are DELETE issues with deleting a review
- Login errors problem persists: make a login error, return to home and bottom content will be replaced by login pg
- Have seen similar errors to above from results page also
- Besides bug, Login page css is fucked up mang, wtf does "global container" come from?
- clicking category link on results page doesn't cause re-render of results
- Login bug occurs when Upload pics fails or succeeds???
  - It looks like handleuploads button is not preventing default, which is submitting the form.

Incomplete
- Picture carousel doesn't work
- Make more DB seeds & refactor method of getting featured on homepage
- Delete map markers properly
- stars lighting up on write review page

To Do
- In order to achieve mobile friendly, we have to add @media queries to EVERY CSS file
- Cities missing under yelp Brooklyn on main pg
- Tooltips for buttons on results page
- Make all foods lead to restaurant
- Change bounds upon changing location (means we need to find out how gmaps defines bounds on locations)
- hover function for map markers that displays another bizindexitem in a square
- redo search in map area

Recent changes
- Made a div for gray bg on the business page. It is encaged in the main div. Should there be a bigger wrapper to contain it?
- attempting to increase search strength little by little. Got rid of case sensitivity with "ILIKE"
- Categories seems to be deeply embedded, need to examine the entire reducer route to change it
- add pg_search gem for more dynamic searching
- Included all instructions for business model and custom migration
- PG search is working but combining categories and name makes it fail
- It seems like the search query is conflicting with the bounds query or category query
- Combined the two into 1 single PG search, it works now. Except that caps messes it up.

- taking a break from backend, fixed styling for results biz, biz right columns, biz show and others

Filter Buttons Progress
- Started doing this and then realized that I was stuck in the jquery mindset of changing
classnames to re-render elements, however, I should do it the correct React way instead
- Begin react style logic updates, only updating the state & reading from it.
- State updates correctly but only after the first time. The first time is always fail. OK,
according to stackex, its doing it correctly, just too fast
- Not sure how to re-render after getting the correct state update. I guess I should make
the component smaller
- convert into smaller func component
- all filters now working as frontend, need to connect backend
- Can probably improve by re-using single filter button and customizing
- Main component needs to collect info from buttons, current style violates unidirectional flow
- Made some filter update logic but it needs to grab info from childrens
- When button is declared in results, set a relationship to parent's state with child's State
- when child state changes, it should update parent, parent will then send a request to backend
to filter the businesses that appear.
- success on uni data flow with open button copy this for others
- button frontend is complete, need to connect filters with backend
- need to look back at true/false toggles because params come out opposite (not fixed)
- Started to look at backend filtering options...maybe it should be done on frontend?
  - dollars 2,3,4 doesnt change the state when it was working before...
  - GOt the new dollar system to work for #1, logs are late but it does it. Apply to others.
- Trying to implement a new filtering method using renderables and a new state for filtered biz
- Test case success! Now implement the comments in analyzeBiz to reflect filters
- buttons now interact with renderables properly. Need to refine analyzebiz or break it up
- takeout filter is now working but its backwards as feared.
- simplified Dollars container, still bugged. Tried adding zero, still reversed.
- reversing bug is a bit better, apply DOllars[1] setstate syntax to everything else
- experiments with toggle: when html is reversed, the bool states are correct but starts off activated
- more elegant ternary for toggle in opennow, copy this.
- fix: price filter is proccing even though it is off, look at bizfilter & seperate out stuff
- changed openfilter to cash filter for simpicity
- the thing about the toggle bug: When the behavior is correct, it starts as ON. When wrong, it needs 1 cycle to activate.

Add Business Progress
- Put red search bar on top
- Need to look back at cloudinary upload for pics
- setup backend to receive and persist to db
- steps:
  - prep state to receive form params
  - put values and onchange methods for form fields, test these in log
  - values are now being sent to server correctly except address needs to be combined before sending
  - address parser now complete, need to work on: categories, upload pics
  - consulting cloudinary for uploader
  - uploader is online. Maybe we need to set up the env stuff again (i guess not)
  - uploads are working, it needs to setState pictures value as the returned url(s) forEach results[0].secure_url
  - state has been set correctly
  - Current errors to work on:
  Map lat can't be blank",
  "Map lng can't be blank",
  "Price can't be blank", (done)
  "Categories business must belong to at least one category",
  "User must exist" (fixed)
  add extra bools (done)
  next: Either look at gmaps address to coords methods OR look at manipulating categories inside createNewBusiness

Mobile Progress
- homepage splash, nav and search complete (exception: location field)
- hompage bottom done except for global footer
- The threshold seemed wrong. Trying 480 instead of 320.
- OK trying 375 AND 480. Must put 480 first.
- Generally working much better, fix footer & apply to rest

next
- do css media queries for rest of pages
- do location links
- make more seeds using faker for quickness
- quick seeding won't work because i have to make up addresses that will show up
