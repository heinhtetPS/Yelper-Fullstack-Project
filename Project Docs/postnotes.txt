Incomplete

- Delete map markers properly
- More robust search

To Do
- Make this entire site mobile friendly
- Make search more intuitive for random people. Show some results. Change bk to ny
- Cities missing under yelp Brooklyn on main pg
- Make all foods lead to restaurant
- Change bounds upon changing location (means we need to find out how gmaps defines bounds on locations)

Recent changes
- Made a div for gray bg on the business page. It is encaged in the main div. Should there be a bigger wrapper to contain it?
- attempting to increase search strength little by little. Got rid of case sensitivity with "ILIKE"
- Next target for search is Name.
- Categories seems to be deeply embedded, need to examine the entire reducer route to change it
- add pg_search gem for more dynamic searching
- pg_search seems to make no difference. Not sure how to use.
- Included all instructions for business model and custom migration
- Made a more correct query for business search but it still doesn't work
