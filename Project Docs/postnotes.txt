Issues
- Review post reportedly has problems on different machines
- Sometimes there are DELETE issues with deleting a review
- Login errors problem persists: make a login error, return to home and bottom content will be replaced by login pg





Incomplete
- Picture carousel doesn't work
- Buttons for filtering are hidden as they are incomplete (results page)
- Make more DB seeds & refactor method of getting featured on homepage
- Delete map markers properly
- More robust search
- better styling for business page right side
- stars lighting up on write review page
-

To Do
- Make this entire site mobile friendly
- Make search more intuitive for random people. Show some results.
- Cities missing under yelp Brooklyn on main pg
- Make all foods lead to restaurant
- Change bounds upon changing location (means we need to find out how gmaps defines bounds on locations)

Recent changes
- Made a div for gray bg on the business page. It is encaged in the main div. Should there be a bigger wrapper to contain it?
- attempting to increase search strength little by little. Got rid of case sensitivity with "ILIKE"
- Next target for search is Name.
- Categories seems to be deeply embedded, need to examine the entire reducer route to change it
- add pg_search gem for more dynamic searching
- Included all instructions for business model and custom migration
- PG search is working but combining categories and name makes it fail
- It seems like the search query is conflicting with the bounds query or category query
- Should I make a search controller that is seperate from the business controller? How can this integrate into the entire redux cycle?
