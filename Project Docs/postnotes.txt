Issues
- Review post reportedly has problems on different machines
- Sometimes there are DELETE issues with deleting a review
- Login errors problem persists: make a login error, return to home and bottom content will be replaced by login pg
- Have seen similar errors to above from results page also
- For categories links, on results page there's too many spaces, on business show, theres none


Incomplete
- Picture carousel doesn't work
- Buttons for filtering are hidden as they are incomplete (results page)
- Make more DB seeds & refactor method of getting featured on homepage
- Delete map markers properly
- stars lighting up on write review page

To Do
- Make this entire site mobile friendly
- In order to achieve mobile friendly, we have to add @media queries to EVERY CSS file
- Cities missing under yelp Brooklyn on main pg
- Tooltips for buttons on results page
- Make all foods lead to restaurant
- Change bounds upon changing location (means we need to find out how gmaps defines bounds on locations)

Recent changes
- Made a div for gray bg on the business page. It is encaged in the main div. Should there be a bigger wrapper to contain it?
- attempting to increase search strength little by little. Got rid of case sensitivity with "ILIKE"
- Categories seems to be deeply embedded, need to examine the entire reducer route to change it
- add pg_search gem for more dynamic searching
- Included all instructions for business model and custom migration
- PG search is working but combining categories and name makes it fail
- It seems like the search query is conflicting with the bounds query or category query
- Combined the two into 1 single PG search, it works now. Except that caps messes it up.

- taking a break from backend, fixed styling for results biz, biz right columns, biz show and others

Filter Buttons Progress
- Started doing this and then realized that I was stuck in the jquery mindset of changing
classnames to re-render elements, however, I should do it the correct React way instead
- Begin react style logic updates, only updating the state & reading from it.
- State updates correctly but only after the first time. The first time is always fail. OK,
according to stackex, its doing it correctly, just too fast
- Not sure how to re-render after getting the correct state update. I guess I should make
the component smaller
- convert into smaller func component
- all filters now working as frontend, need to connect backend
- Can probably improve by re-using single filter button and customizing
- Main component needs to collect info from buttons, current style violates unidirectional flow
- Made some filter update logic but it needs to grab info from childrens
- When button is declared in results, set a relationship to parent's state with child's State
- when child state changes, it should update parent, parent will then send a request to backend
to filter the businesses that appear.
- success on uni data flow with open button copy this for others
- button frontend is complete, need to connect filters with backend
- need to look back at true/false toggles because params come out opposite (fixed)
- Started to look at backend filtering options...maybe it should be done on frontend?
  - dollars 2,3,4 doesnt change the state when it was working before...
  - redo entire dollars state with ON, OFF and NULL
  - GOt the new dollar system to work for #1, logs are late but it does it. Apply to others.
- Realized that my entire system doesn't account for what happens when you turn off a filter (all business has to return to default state)
- Trying to implement a new filtering method using renderables and a new state for filtered biz
- Test case success! Now implement the comments in analyzeBiz to reflect filters
- buttons now interact with renderables properly. Need to refine analyzebiz or break it up
- takeout filter is now working but its backwards as feared.
- simplified Dollars container, still bugged. Tried adding zero, still reversed.
- reversing bug is a bit better, apply DOllars[1] setstate syntax to everything else


Mobile Progress
- homepage splash, nav and search complete (exception: location field)
- hompage bottom done except for global footer
- The threshold seemed wrong. Trying 480 instead of 320.
- OK trying 375 AND 480. Must put 480 first.
- Generally working much better, fix footer & apply to rest

next
- do css media queries for rest of pages
- do location links
- make more seeds using faker for quickness
- quick seeding won't work because i have to make up addresses that will show up
